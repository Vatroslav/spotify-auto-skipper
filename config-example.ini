# ============================================================
# Spotify Auto-Skipper Configuration
# ============================================================
# This configuration file is used by the Spotify Auto-Skipper app.
# It allows you to control how recently played songs are skipped,
# and provides the API credentials for Spotify and Last.fm.
# ============================================================

[LastFM]
# 👤 Your Last.fm username (the one you scrobble under).
username = YourLastFMUsername

# 🔑 Your Last.fm API key.
#    Create one here: https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
api_key = your_lastfm_api_key

[Spotify]
# 🎧 Your Spotify API credentials.
#    1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
#    2. Create a new app (or use an existing one)
#    3. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret below
client_id = your_spotify_client_id
client_secret = your_spotify_client_secret

# 🔁 Your Spotify refresh token.
#    You can obtain it using a Spotify token generator like:
#    https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples
#    or any online tool for “Spotify OAuth Refresh Token”.
refresh_token = your_spotify_refresh_token

[Settings]
# Number of days during which a previously played song will be skipped.
# Example: 60 means songs played in the last 60 days are skipped.
skip_window_days = 60

# How often (in seconds) the script checks your currently playing track.
# Example: 120 means every 2 minutes.
# Minimum: 5 seconds (enforced to avoid Spotify API rate limiting).
poll_interval_seconds = 120

# Sometimes Spotify begins playing songs in the same order as a few days ago. Then the auto-skipper will skip a song, check the next song, skip it, check the next one, skip, and so on. They'll mostly have the same number of days since last being played. The solution is that after the 5th song is skipped with the same or ±1 day, start playing the playlist again. Manually, you do this by starting to play a different playlist, and then immediately starting playing the original playlist. Of course, the playlist is played in Shuffle mode.
# enable_restart_pattern can be true or false.
enable_restart_pattern = true
# restart_pattern_song_count is how many songs in a row to check before restarting the playlist
restart_pattern_song_count = 5
# restart_pattern_day_diff is how many days of difference are there in when was the song last played
restart_pattern_day_diff = 2

# Spotify playlist ID to use when the app needs to switch temporarily.
# Can be any public or private playlist you own (used as a dummy switch target).
# Example: 37i9dQZF1DXcBWIGoYBM5M
dummy_playlist_id = your_dummy_playlist_id_here

# Dropbox direct download link to your remote_control.txt file.
# The file should contain ON or OFF on the first line.
# Example: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/abcdef123456/remote_control.txt?rlkey=xyz
remote_control_url = https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/.../remote_control.txt?rlkey=...

# Whether to always play tracks that are in your Liked Songs (Saved Tracks) playlist.
# Set to true to always play liked songs (they will never be skipped)
# Set to false to skip liked songs (same as other songs)
# Default: true (liked songs are always played)
always_play_liked_songs = true

# Comma-separated list of Spotify artist IDs that should never be skipped.
# Songs from these artists will always play, regardless of when they were last scrobbled.
# Example: 3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2,4Z8W4fKeB5YxbusRsdQVPb
# To find an artist's Spotify ID, go to the artist's Spotify page, click Share -> Copy link to artist
# The ID is the last part of the URL (e.g., spotify.com/artist/3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2)
# Leave empty to disable this feature.
